      "content": "This election has been a bit of a conundrum for women. On the one hand, it has given us our best and closest chance at the first female president, but it has also produced extreme vitriol against women not seen in any previous presidential election.

And since store-bought ensembles can cost a pretty penny, it is never a bad idea to try and curate an outfit yourself. It also helps to use ordinary items that can be used again instead of collecting dust in the depths of your closet.",
